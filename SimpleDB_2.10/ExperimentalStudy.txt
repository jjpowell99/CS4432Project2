Analysis:
	The times for selection queries were all about the same of 15-16 ms, excluding the outliers of 254 and 0 
which is expected due to the relatively low size of our tables. The times for the join queries 
matched our expectations in terms of performance results, as the average times were all within 320 ms,
but the table with no index performed the quickest due to the low number of records used and less 
overhead. Our extensible hash index performed better on average than the other two indices, 
describing potential for even more advantages with larger tables.
