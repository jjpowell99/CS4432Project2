Installing Modified our simpledb
-----------------------------------
The modified version of SimpleDB is installed and functions in
the same way as the original SimpleDB program.

In order to run SimpleDB:
	1. Run Startup.java with a parameter describing the name of 
	the working directory for the SimpleDB server. The Startup.java 
	file can be found under the simpledb.server package in the src folder. 
	2. The database may then be interacted with through the studentClient/simpledb folder by either:
		a. Running set commands in the java files found in the , 
		other than SQLInterpreter.java. 
			- The program of set commands to demonstrate SimpleDB functionality for task 1 
			of CS 4432 Project 1 is Example.java in this folder. 
			- The program used to produce the testing output and results is Testing.java
		b. Running SQLInterpreter.java may be run from this location to provide a prompt, where a subset 
		of SQL may be directly entered to interact with database.  

If one wishes to revert to the original version of SimpleDB, one must 
change the BufferMgr.java file under the simpledb.buffer package in the 
src folder. Within this file on line 42 the instantiation of the buffer manager must be changed from 
"LRUBufferMgr(numbuffers)" to "BasicBufferMgr(numbuffers)".
