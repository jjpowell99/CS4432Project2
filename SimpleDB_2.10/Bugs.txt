Known bugs:

1) 	The cs4432db folder should be deleted and the server restarted before running examples.java or test.java
	as the insert statements will create repeat values in the tables if ran again.
	
2) 	The folder cs4432db is known to cause problems. Sometimes deleting it and restarting the server will fix
	these bugs. 
	
3) 	If the times are longer for our improved system please try again, on average ours is much better.


PROJECT 2 BUGS:

1) 	Our extensible hash is implemented using data structures rather than files, this means that the test file and
	the table creation file must be ran in the same instance of Startup. So run: Startup -> CreateTestTables -> ExtensibleHashTest

2) 	Our hashing is based on the hash value of the dataval object of the nodes. We set our bucket size to be 16
	consequently, if more than 16 identical dataval objects are added the program may experience unexpected behavior.
	However, this is unlikely to occur unless there is deliberate sabotage with the insertions.
	
3)	Not really a bug, just a consequence of the toString method. When we print out the contents of the hashmap in the
	extensible hash, the program prints out every pointer and it's respective bucket. This makes it appear that there
	are more buckets than there actually are, since the pointers may point to the same bucket depending on how the 
	splitting occurs.
	
4)	SimpleDB sometimes pins everything in it's buffers. Consequently, large operations, such as joins, sometimes fail
	during testing.
