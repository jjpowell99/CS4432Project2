Known bugs:

1) 	The cs4432db folder should be deleted and the server restarted before running examples.java or test.java
	as the insert statements will create repeat values in the tables if ran again.
	
2) 	The folder cs4432db is known to cause problems. Sometimes deleting it and restarting the server will fix
	these bugs. 
	
3) 	If the times are longer for our improved system please try again, on average ours is much better.
