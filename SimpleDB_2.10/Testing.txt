Testing.txt
Andrew Nolan and Jackson Powell

To run the tests for our version of simple.db you 
must use the Testing.java file. This code will run
many sql statements and print out the time they
took to execute. Running this with the LRUBufferMgr
and then with the BasicBufferMgr enabled you can
compare the times to see which ran more efficiently.
You can tell that our version of the buffer manager,
the LRU version, was more efficient due to the 
improved times. An example output can be viewed
below.

Our testing queries were carefully chosen to be the
same as in Examples.java to demonstrate that we did
not break any functionality of simple.db during our
improvements. The tests cover a wide assortment of
sql: selects, deletes, updates, inserts, create 
tables, create views, and joins. We think that
this demonstrates an ample coverage of the simple
db system and shows that our improvements do not
break the code and in fact improve its efficiency.

==============================================
The Real Important Stuff
==============================================
To see the improvements of our system testing.java
should be ran multiple times with both BasicBufferMgr
and with LRUBufferMgr. The results of our tests were as follows:

LRU: 3502ms 2176ms 2493ms 2435ms 2113ms 	| avg=2543.8ms
Basic: 2259ms 2567ms 3068ms 3842ms 2951ms	| avg=2937.4ms

As can be seen on average the testing file is almost half
a second faster with our improved system.
The best and worst case scenarios are also both better for
our improved code. 

Please run the tests and see for yourself. (Remember to 
delete the database and restart it before running the 
tests again.)

Besides time our memory allocation is far superior,
as can be seen below. 

Status of the BasicBufferMgr's buffer after running testing.java

Basic Buffer Manager
ID: 0, Block: [file fldcat.tbl, block 1], Pin Count: 1
ID: 1, Block: [file viewcat.tbl, block 0], Pin Count: 0
ID: 2, Block: null, Pin Count: 0
ID: 3, Block: null, Pin Count: 0
ID: 4, Block: null, Pin Count: 0
ID: 5, Block: null, Pin Count: 0
ID: 6, Block: null, Pin Count: 0
ID: 7, Block: null, Pin Count: 0

Status of the LRUBufferMgr's buffer after running testing.java:

LRU Buffer Manager
ID: 0, Block: [file fldcat.tbl, block 1], Pin Count: 0
ID: 1, Block: [file course.tbl, block 0], Pin Count: 1
ID: 2, Block: [file professor.tbl, block 0], Pin Count: 2
ID: 3, Block: [file fldcat.tbl, block 0], Pin Count: 0
ID: 4, Block: [file viewcat.tbl, block 0], Pin Count: 0
ID: 5, Block: [file fldcat.tbl, block 3], Pin Count: 0
ID: 6, Block: [file fldcat.tbl, block 2], Pin Count: 0
ID: 7, Block: [file teaching.tbl, block 0], Pin Count: 2


As you can see the buffer is fully utilized in our version as opposed
to the basic version. This allows for a more effective use of memory and
thus better optimization.


This buffer utilization through the LRU replacement policy may also be seen 
for the buffer states shown below that occurred for the creation of the 
Professor table when running Testing.java.
