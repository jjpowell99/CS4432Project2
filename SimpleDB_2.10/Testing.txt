Testing.txt
Andrew Nolan and Jackson Powell

To run the tests for our version of simple.db you 
must use the Testing.java file. This code will run
many sql statements and print out the time they
took to execute. Running this with the LRUBufferMgr
and then with the BasicBufferMgr enabled you can
compare the times to see which ran more efficiently.
You can tell that our version of the buffer manager,
the LRU version, was more efficient due to the 
improved times. An example output can be viewed
below.
